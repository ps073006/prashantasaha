MTTester is a tool to apply Metamorphic Testing(MT) technique on any java class based software system. This tool manages to test system programs by using test cases given by the user. In this tool Users can create any meaningful MR to test their program and run it through this tool. Users can give MRs and initial test inputs in a XML file. The central idea is that although it is impossible to directly test the correctness of any given test case, it is easy to verify the relationships of the output generated by multiple executions of a program.
