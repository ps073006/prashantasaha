## Traveling:
I love to travel around the world during my break. I have visited many beautiful places in the United States. I have also  traveled Germany, France, Netherlands, Switzerland, 
Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. There are many places in my bucket list that are yet to be visited. 

## Sports:
I love to watch and play cricket and football. My favorite cricket team is the Bangladesh National Cricket team. I am a big fan of Football Club Barcelona. And my all time 
favorite player is Sachin Tendulkar (Cricket) and Lionel Messi (Football).

I love to cook variety of dishes.
