I am a 5th year PhD student in Gianforte School of Computing at Montana State University (MSU), Bozeman, Montana. My PhD advisor is [Dr. Upulee Kanewala] (https://sites.google.com/view/upuleegk/home). I am interested in testing scientific softwares. My current research focus is on automated test case generation for
scientific softwares using Metamorphic Testing. I have worked with the Software Testing lab at MSU to build a software testing tool called "METTester". You can find more about 
my research in the [publications] (https://prashantasaha.github.io/publications/) tab.

Before starting my PhD, I have worked at a health information technology company named IQVIA (formerly IMS Health) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
I have worked there for 3 years as a Software Engineer. I have earned my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering degree from Rajshahi University of
Engineering and Technology (RUET) in 2012.
